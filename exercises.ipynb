    "Create a function `palindrome(word)` that receives a string and returns `True` or `False` depending on whether it is a palindrome.  A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Examples of palindromes are `racecar` and `Nurses Run`. This function can be case *insensitive*, and it should ignore spaces and punctuation.\n",
